# CopticResources
# Website - http://student.athabascau.ca/~georgegh/
# The purpose of this website is to help my local perish and those interested, to facilitate the accessing of educational resources that are related to the Coptic Orthodox Church. As an active member of the local church community I realized that a lot of the educational resources available were hard copy and difficult to pass from one person to another for usage. Moreover, there wasnâ€™t one singular resource for learning but multiple. Creating a website for everyone in my perish to learn from and use was needed. The website is formal/professional and the audience is anyone who is interested in learning history, hymns, sacraments, rites and the basics pertaining to the Coptic Church, that is the ultimate focus. It has a curriculum for those who want a step by step guide on what to learn. The goal is to have an organized online educational resource pertaining to the hymns, sacraments, learning curriculum, rites and more about Coptic Church for both members of the perish and anyone who is interested in learning.
